Non-Profit:

   "Creative Aging accomplishes its mission by bringing local area professional artists, performers and educators to present one hour long programs at senior centers, retirement communities, adult day care centers, and nursing homes in Cincinnati and surrounding areas. In 2019, Creative Aging sponsored 640 programs at member facilities serving 18,750 older adults in the Greater Cincinnati area. Over the years, Creative Aging Cincinnati has provided well over 9300 programs and touched the lives of over 375,000 seniors!" - Creative Aging Cincinnati's website.

Project:

   This project will serve as a tool to track attendance numbers for arts events hosted for seniors in the Cincinnati area. Instead of their current spreadsheet system, Creative Aging will be able to enter data into the database we've built and generate reports from the data based on different parameters. Ease of use and flexibility were two main focuses of our design philosophy in the hopes that we can make managing data easier for our users. We have achieved the base fuctionality of this tool, and plan to continue working with Creative Aging to implement several features in the future, including data entry via file upload and more robust ways to handle the stored data.


Instructions for setting up this project:

    To configure the database access for phpmyadmin, change the value of DB_SETTINGS inside the DataLoader.php
    file to whatever your local server is. File path: main/_classes/DataLoader.php
